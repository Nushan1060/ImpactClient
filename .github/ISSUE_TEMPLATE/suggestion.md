### What is your suggestion?

adding more items to the auto mining feature

### Why is it useful?

automining is already a huge leap by far, somehow it mainly focuses on main ores and coal only by this time, it would be more usefull if it can mine Nether Quarts and wood as the same way it does for the others.
